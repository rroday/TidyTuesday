# TidyTuesday


# My 2021 resolution is to learn new ways to display and interpret data by participating in Tidy Tuesday. As a college senior in biological science, I am no coding whiz, but hopefully, I can create some professional-looking graphs and images and learn how to use GitHub along the way.
